<div id="npm">
    <h4>NPM</h4>
    <p>NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is a software package manager for the JavaScript programming language,
        primarily used for managing packages and dependencies for Node.js projects.</p>
    <p>NPM is used to install and manage packages, which are pre-written code modules that can be easily integrated into
        a project to provide additional functionality or simplify the development process. These packages can be
        installed globally or locally, depending on the project's needs.</p>
    <p>NPM also allows developers to create and publish their own packages, which can be shared with the wider
        community. This encourages collaboration and the sharing of ideas and code, which can help to speed up the
        development process and improve the quality of software.</p>
    <p>To use NPM, developers need to have Node.js installed on their computer. NPM comes bundled with Node.js, so it is
        automatically installed when Node.js is installed. Developers can then use the command line interface to run NPM
        commands, such as installing and managing packages, publishing packages, and updating dependencies.</p>

<div id="nodemon">
    <h4>Nodemon.</h4>
    <p>Nodemon is a handy tool that is used during Node.js development to automatically restart the Node.js application
        when any changes are made to the source code. It monitors the files in the directory and any subdirectories of
        the directory where nodemon is run, and it automatically restarts the Node.js application when it detects any
        changes.</p>
    <p>Nodemon is useful because it saves developers time by eliminating the need to manually stop and restart the
        Node.js application every time a change is made. This allows developers to focus on writing code rather than
        worrying about restarting the application after every change.</p>
    <p>Nodemon is installed using npm (Node Package Manager), and it is used from the command line by running the
        nodemon command followed by the name of the Node.js application file.
        For example, if the Node.js application file is named app.js, the command to start the application with nodemon
        would be:</p>
    <code>nodemon app.js</code>

<div id="vercel">
    <h4>Vercel</h4>
    <p>Vercel is a cloud platform that provides hosting and deployment services for web applications, including static
        sites, single-page applications, and serverless functions. It was founded in 2015 by Guillermo Rauch, who is
        also the creator of the Next.js framework for building server-side-rendered React applications.</p>
    <p>Vercel's platform is designed to provide fast and reliable deployment of web applications by leveraging modern
        web technologies such as serverless computing and edge caching. It supports a variety of popular frameworks and
        languages, including React, Vue.js, Angular, and Node.js.</p>
    <p>One of the key features of Vercel is its integration with Git workflows. Users can deploy their applications
        directly from a Git repository, making it easy to keep their development and deployment processes streamlined
        and efficient. Vercel also provides features such as automatic HTTPS, custom domains, and advanced caching
        options to help ensure the security and performance of web applications.</p>
    <p>In addition to its hosting and deployment services, Vercel also provides a number of tools and resources for
        developers, including a command-line interface (CLI), a web-based dashboard for managing deployments, and
        extensive documentation and tutorials. Vercel's platform is used by a wide range of organizations, from small
        startups to large enterprises, to deploy and scale their web applications.</p>

<div id="git">
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It was
        created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel.</p>
    <p>Git allows developers to collaborate on a project and keep track of changes to the codebase over time. It enables
        developers to work on different branches of the codebase simultaneously, merge changes from different branches,
        and revert to previous versions of the code if necessary.</p>
    <p>Git uses a distributed architecture, meaning that each developer has a local copy of the code repository, and
        changes can be synchronized with a central repository hosted on a server. This allows developers to work on the
        codebase offline and then sync their changes with the central repository later.</p>
    <p>Git has become one of the most popular version control systems in use today, and it is widely used in both
        open-source and commercial software development. It has also become an important tool for collaboration and code
        sharing in the software development community, with many popular code hosting platforms like GitHub and GitLab
        providing support for Git.</p>
    <p>Some useful Git commands:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>git add .</code>: This command adds all changes in the working directory to the Git staging area. It
            does not include changes to deleted files or newly created files.</li>
        <li><code>git add filename</code>: This command adds changes made to a specific file to the Git staging area.
        </li>
        <li><code>git commit -m "commit message here"</code>: This command creates a new commit in the Git repository
            with the changes that have been added to the staging area. The commit message is used to describe the
            changes made in the commit. It is recommended to provide a descriptive commit message to help others
            understand the purpose of the changes.</li>
        <li><code>git push</code>: This command uploads the local Git repository changes to a remote repository,
            typically hosted on a Git server such as GitHub or GitLab. This command is used to share changes with others
            and keep the remote repository in sync with the local repository. If more working with branches and the like
            the user will need to specify the name of
            the remote repository and branch they want to push to, for example: <code>git push origin master</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> The gitignore file</h4>
    <p>A <code>.gitignore</code> file is a text file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore when tracking
        changes in a repository. It is a simple way to prevent certain files or directories from being committed to the
        repository, as well as preventing them from cluttering your local working directory.</p>
    <p>For example, you may want to ignore temporary files, log files, build output, or files containing sensitive
        information like passwords or API keys. By adding these file or directory names to the <code>.gitignore</code>
        file, Git will ignore them and they won't be included in any commits or shown as unstaged changes in your
        working directory.</p>
    <p><code>.gitignore</code> files can be added to your repository's root directory or any subdirectory. Git will
        automatically read and apply the rules in the <code>.gitignore</code> file for the directory it is located in
        and its subdirectories. You can also have multiple <code>.gitignore</code> files in different directories if
        needed.</p>
    <p>It's important to note that <code>.gitignore</code> files only affect untracked files. If a file has already been
        committed to the repository, it will continue to be tracked by Git even if it is added to the
        <code>.gitignore</code> file later. In this case, you would need to manually remove the file from the repository
        using <code>git rm --cached</code> to stop tracking it.</p>
