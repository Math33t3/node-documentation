    <h4>RESTful Web APIs in General</h4>
    <p>A RESTful API uses HTTP requests to perform operations on resources identified by URIs (Uniform Resource
        Identifiers). It relies on a stateless, client-server architecture, where the server provides resources, and the
        client makes requests to those resources.</p>
    <p>The main principles of RESTful API design are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Resources should be identified by a unique URI, and requests to the resource should be sent to that URI.
        </li>
        <li>Requests should be stateless, meaning that each request should contain all the information necessary for the
            server to understand and process the request.</li>
        <li>The server should provide a consistent interface for accessing and modifying resources, using HTTP verbs
            such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.</li>
        <li>Responses from the server should be in a standardized format, such as JSON or XML.</li>
        <li>The API should be discoverable, meaning that clients should be able to explore and navigate the available
            resources.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>The client/server model</h4>
    <p>This model is a common model for communication between two software applications, typically over a network such
        as the Internet. In this model, one application (the client) sends a request for information or action to
        another application (the server), and the server responds to the request with the requested information or
        action.</p>
    <p>The client/server request/response model is based on a simple sequence of events:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The client sends a request to the server, which typically includes information about the action or
            information the client is requesting.</li>
        <li>The server receives the request and processes it, often by retrieving data or performing some action based
            on the request.</li>
        <li>The server sends a response back to the client, which typically includes the requested information or
            confirmation of the action performed.</li>
        <li>The client receives the response and can then use the information or take further action based on the
            response.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This model is widely used in many different types of applications, including web applications, mobile
        applications, and many other types of client/server systems.</p>

<h4>Designing your API</h4>
<p>When designing an API, there are some conventions to make it easier to create and to troubleshoot, manage and
    maintain in the future, some of these are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clear and descriptive names that accurately reflect the functionality of the API endpoint or resource.</li>
    <li>Use lowercase letters with hyphens to separate words in URL paths. For example, /users/new-user.</li>
    <li>Use nouns for resources and verbs for actions, and remember to use plural nouns for collections and singular
        nouns for individual resources. For example, use /users to represent a collection of users and /users/1 to
        represent a single user.</li>
    <li>HTTP methods should indicate the type of action being performed. For example, use GET to retrieve data, POST to
        create new data, PUT or PATCH to update existing data, and DELETE to delete data.</li>
    <li>Consistent naming conventions throughout the API. For example, if you use snake_case for resource names, use it
        consistently for all resources. Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms unless they are well-known and commonly
        used in the industry.</li>
    <li>Remember to sort the endpoints in your application, the priority should be, Get, Post, Put, Patch and delete at
        last. This helps the developer to navigate the application during the entire lifespan of the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, this sums up how to order route methods and the naming conventions of the endpoints.</p>
