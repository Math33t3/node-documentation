    <h4>Rendering HTML in the browser</h4>
    <p>When an HTML page is rendered in a browser these steps happen to create the page in front of your screen:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The browser requests the HTML from the server. When it gets it,</li>
        <li>parses the HTML and creates a Document Object Model (DOM) tree, which represents the structure of the page.
            It starts at the top of the HTML page and as it reads the links to other static files, it sends a request to
            get those files from the server as well.</li>
        <li>The browser receives the CSS, JavaScript and other static files from the server.</li>
        <li>The browser uses the CSS files to apply styles to the elements in the DOM tree, creating a Render Tree.</li>
        <li>The browser combines the DOM tree and the Render Tree to create the Layout Tree, which determines the exact
            position and size of each element on the page.</li>
        <li>The browser then renders the page by painting each element on the screen in the correct position and with
            the correct styles.</li>
        <li>Any JavaScript code included in the page is executed after the page has been rendered. This code can
            manipulate the DOM tree and update the page dynamically, without requiring a full page refresh.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It's important to note that this process can take some time, particularly if the page includes a lot of
        JavaScript code or complex CSS styles. This is why client-side rendering can sometimes result in a slow initial
        loading time, particularly on slower internet connections or older devices.</p>
    <p>In contrast, server-side rendering (SSR) involves generating the HTML on the server and sending it to the client
        as a fully-rendered page, which can improve initial loading time and help with search engine optimization.</p>

<div id="serverside-rendering">
    <h4>Serverside rendering</h4>
    <p>Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique used in web development where a web page is generated on the server
        and then sent to the client to be displayed in the user's browser. SSR is an alternative to client-side
        rendering (CSR), where the web page is generated in the browser using JavaScript after the page is loaded.</p>
    <p>One of the main benefits of SSR is that it can improve the initial loading speed of a web page. With SSR, the
        server can send the fully rendered HTML to the client, which means the user can see the content right away
        without having to wait for JavaScript to download and execute. This can be especially important for users on
        slow or unreliable internet connections.</p>
    <p>Another benefit of SSR is that it can improve search engine optimization (SEO). Search engines like Google can
        more easily crawl and index the content of a server-rendered web page, which can improve its visibility in
        search results.</p>
    <p>However, SSR can also have some drawbacks. For example, it can be more difficult to implement and maintain
        compared to CSR, and it may not work as well for complex, dynamic web applications.</p>
    <p>Overall, the decision to use SSR or CSR will depend on the specific needs and goals of a web application. In some
        cases, a hybrid approach that combines both techniques may be the best solution.</p>
